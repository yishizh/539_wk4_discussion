Discussion Week Four Instructions
Set Up
If you have any questions regarding these steps, please come to office hours!
Download code from this week's discussion repo
Place in your 539 folder
Open the files in Visual Studio Code
Part One: Add Classes
Classes allow you to style specific sections differently
In your pastries.html, add classes to two different divs or sections
Add class="special" to one section
Add class="highlight" to another section
Part Two: Box Model Practice
For HW2, you need to control margins, padding, and borders on specific sides
In your style.css, style the .special class:
Add a background color (use 6-digit hex value like #FF6B6B)
Add left margin only: margin-left: 50px;
Add top and left padding: padding-top: 15px; and padding-left: 15px;
Add borders on specific sides: border-left: 5px solid #FFFFFF; and border-bottom: 2px solid #FFFFFF;
Style the .highlight class:
Add a different background color (6-digit hex)
Add right margin only: margin-right: 50px;
Add border-radius: border-radius: 10px;
Part Three: Pseudo-Classes
Pseudo-classes let you style elements based on their state or position
:hover - Style on mouse over
Make your navigation links change color when hovering
Try making your h2 headings change color on hover
:focus - Style for keyboard navigation (accessibility!)
Add focus styles to your links: outline: 3px solid #FFD700;
Test it: Press Tab on your page and watch the focus move between links
:last-child - Style the last element
Make the last item in your navigation look different
Or make the last paragraph in a section stand out
Tip - If you don't know how to do something, Google is your friend!
Part Four: Inspect Element
Use browser tools to see how the box model works
Open your Live Server
Right-click on your .special div and select "Inspect" or "Inspect Element"
Look at the box model diagram - see the margins, padding, and borders
Hover over your links - watch the styles change in the Styles panel
Press Tab key to navigate - see :focus styles activate
Part Five: Submission
Take a screenshot of Inspect Element open on your live server
Make sure we can see both:
Your styled pastries page
The Inspect Element panel showing the box model
Submit your screenshot to Canvas before the end of discussion
Comment the word of the day in Canvas
